## 1. Intro to RStudio

* Why R
* RStudio as interface for R(IDE)
* The 4 Windows of R studio
      * open new file:  go to File->New File->R script. We will use it to record our commands.
      * focus on console: interactive; read-execute-print loop
      * Navigation commands
          * From console: `getwd()` Press `enter` to execute command. Notice the help you are getting. Did it work?
              * Parantheses identify command as a function
              * Built-in vs custom-made functions
              * Function call without arguments
              
          * From console: `setwd()`. Notice tab completion options. Press `enter` to execute. Error! Can you tell why?
          
      * **Challenge 1.1** purpose: `setwd()` to SCW_Jan2016; pass arguments to function
          
* Command flow: from console to editor or the other way around. Try both ways.
      * Look at the history tab in the top right window. Find `getwd()` and `setwd()` commands and move them to source.
      * Make `Sunday_AM` folder in SCW_Jan2016: Run the command from the editor window. Use (Ctrl+Enter) to send it to console window for execution.
          * `dir.create("Sunday_AM")`
      * Which way do you like better? Beginers -> console to editor; later on -> editor to console
    * Go to Sunday_AM directory
        * setwd("C:/Users/Anna/SCW_Jan2016/Sunday_AM")
        * Let's save our R script as myRcommands.R
    
* **Q** You can navigate through your file system(folders) using navigation bar in the bottom right panel, Files folder. Try it. 
Why do you think it might be useful to use commands rather than GUI?


* More about console window:
    * Incomplete commands:
        * Type `5+12`; push `enter` -> `17` is the output on the console
        * Type '5+'; push `enter`-> `+` is the output; incomplete command! Push `Esc` to return to `>`: ready to accept input
    * Cannot reuse the output unless... **Q** How to make the output reusable?

[the above should take no more than 15min]
    
* Variables and Assignment
    * To save the output of any command for future use, assign it to a variable.  We are making objects now that are stored in R's memory.
        * `myKids<-3`; `yourKids<-2`; `ourKids <-myKids+yourKids`
        * `school<-"UTA"`; `city<-"Arlington"`; `mySchool<-paste(school,"in", city)`
    * assigning a new value to the variable with the same name will change the old value
        * `cost<-1` 
        * `cost<-cost+2` The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.
    * newly created objects are stored in memory, you can see what they are in Environment tab, top right window
    * a word about variable names:no spaces, do not start with numbers. Whatever else you do, be consistent

    * **Challenge 1.2** Purpose: assign values to variables

* Manage the environment
    * `ls()` list stored objects in the global environment
    * `rm(x)` remove an object 
    * `rm(list=ls())` remove all objects from environment
        * notice that functions can be nested!!! Very common in R
            * **Together** print the value of sqrt(4) with print() function

* Help functions for understnding functions:
    * `?(functionName)`; `?(rm)`, `?(ls)`: you will be taken to documentation (Help tab/bottom right window )
    * `args(functionName)`

* Where do these functions come from? The functionality of R. Package management. There are over 7,000 packages available on CRAN.

    * You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
    * You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
    * You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
    * You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
    * You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`
    
    *ex:
        * install.packages("ggplot2")
        * library(ggplot2)

## 2. Data types and Data structures

We have already seen variables that store numbers and variables that store text. 
These objects are examples of atomic data types. These the smallest building blocks of R.  We need to understand data types because functions are written to work on specific data types.

There are 5 frequently used atomic types in R. They cannot be broken down into anything smaller:

###**Data Types**

* numeric
    * integer (e.g, `2L`, `as.integer(3)`)
    * double (i.e. decimal) (e.g, `-24.57`, `2.0`, `pi`)
* character (e.g, `"a"`, `"swc"`, `'This is a cat'`)
* logical (e.g., `TRUE`, `FALSE`)
* complex (i.e. complex numbers) (e.g, `1 + 0i`, `1 + 4i`)


There are also help functions to identify the data type of objects:

* typeof() # what is its atomic type?
* is.logical() # is it TRUE/FALSE data?
* is.numeric() # is it numeric?
* is.integer() # is it an integer?
* is.complex() # is it complex number data?
* is.character() # is it character data?
* str()  # what object is it?

**Together**
Suppose I have an object called `score` that has value of `79`:

```
score<-79

Let's see what data type it is. Looks like an integer to me.

is.integer(score)
typeof(score)
typeof(is.integer(score))
typeof(typeof(score))
str(typeof(is.integer(score)))
```
The nested functions are commom, but can be very difficult to read at first.
You can always break expressions like this into smaller chuncks to understand the command

**Challenge 2.1** purpose: Understand nested functions while learning how to use help functions to identify various data types

There are functions to convert one data type into another. Not always possible:

* `y<-as.integer(3)` coersion to integer from double
* `y<-as.integer(3.6)` coersion to integer from decimal [NOT ROUNDING]

**Together** What do you think the output would be?

* `y<-as.integer("5.27")` can coerce a decimal string 
* `y<-as.integer("UTA")`  output: NA: special object = missing value
* `y<-as.integer("TRUE")` you can guess/check `y<-as.integer("FALSE")`

###**Data Structures**

Now we are getting to something interesting. So far we made single-element objects. We can now combine them to make more complex objects, or *data structures*

First, let's take a look at the standard data sets you are likely to work with:
Download the datasset we will be working this morning:[add link to etherpad]
* `https://annawilliford.github.io/2016-01-30-UTA/data/gapminderData.csv`

To practice you Linux shell skills, download fom the command line:

* Open Git Bash-> cd to SCW_Jan2016/Sunday_AM --> mkdir data --> cd data
* `curl -O https://annawilliford.github.io/2016-01-30-UTA/data/gapminderData.csv`
* Open in Excel 
  
This table is represented by a single object in R, known as a data frame.
But it is made up of smaller structures that in turn are made up of the basic single-element data types.

**Together** What would be easiest data structure? Hopefully, vector-like structure will come up

* ####Vectors: most common and basic data structure

    * must contain elements of the **same data type**
    * can contain any of the five data types introduced before
    * how to create: use concatinate function `c()` or `vector()` 
        * `v<-c(1,6,77)`; `x<-c(1:10`); `seq(1,10, by=2)`
        * `v <- vector("character", length = 10)`  empty vectors of predefined length
    
    **Together** Let's make a vector and play with it. Parallels with *bash*
    * `v<-c(1:2,45)`
    * how to examine:
        * `head(x, n=2)`, `tail(x, n=6)`, `length(x)`, `str(x)`
    * how to manipulate: 
        * coercion: just like with data types, ex:`as.character(v)`
        * add an element to the vector: `v <- c(v, 57)`
        * name: `names(v)<-c("a","b","c")`
        * vectorization: function operates on all elements of a vector without a need for a loop:
            * `v2<-2*v`; `v3<-c(1:4)`; `v4<-v2+v3`

* ####Matrices: multi-dimensional vectors:
    * must contain elements of the **same data type**
    * create with matrix():
        * `m<-matrix(c(1:18)), ncol=6, nrow=3)`
    * examine: `dim(m)`, `str(m)`, `nrow(m)`, `ncol(m)`, `length(m)`
    * name: `rownames(m)`, `colnames(m)`
    * check out `?matrix` for more details
    
* ####Factors: vectors that represent categorical data:
    * create with factor()
        * `f<-factor(c("Exp","Exp","C","C","Exp"))`
    *examine:
        * `str(f)`, `typeof()`
    * reorder: for some analysis order matters
        * `f<-factor(f, levels=c("Exp","C"))`
        * ex: `barplot(table(f))` before and after reordering
        
* ####Lists: generic vector
    * usually contain elements of **different data types**
    * to create, use list() function: `l<-list(4,"dogs",TRUE)`
    * **Challenge 2.2** Try to make a more complex list (`myOrder`) that  contains other data structures as list elements
    
    **Together** Ask to apply the following functions to the list they created
    * examine: `length(myOrderInfo)` - unexpected output?
    * `str(myOrderInfo)`
    

* ####Data Frames 

Now we are ready to explore data frames. Go back to you Excel with gapminder dataset. Could you make an informative guess about how this data structure can be represented in R?

**Yes!** It is a list of vectors of equal length. 
Let's modify our `myOrder` list to construct a data frame. What should we change?
```
menuItems<-c("chicken", "soup", "salad", "tea")
menuType<-(factor(c("solid", "liquid", "solid", "liquid"))
menuCost<-c(3.99, 2.99, 4.69, 2.09)
```
Combine as a list:

* `myOrder<-list(menuItems, menuType, menuCost)`
* Check with `str()`; keeps the data  types we asigned

Now combine as data.frame. Ask students to do that. Give it a different name, `myOrder_df`. Why?

* `myOrder_df<-data.frame(menuItems, menuType, menuCost)`
* Check with `str()`; keeps the data types we asigned???

## 3. General subsetting rules

Now let's talk about how to extract elements from various data structures. If you want to manipulate(change/replace/rename) individual elements or parts of the data structure, we need to know how to accesss them  

* Three general ways to subset the data
    * By position index: `v<-c(1:10)`  (element's number within the structure: starts with 1 in R)
        * `v[2]` : square brackets operator =   "get me the nth element".
        * `v[c(3:6)]`; `v[c(1,3,c(8:10))]`; `v[-c(3:5)]` ; negative=drop element
        * with `which` function that extracts the position index of the elements with a specified values:`v<-c(1,3,5,5,7,5)`; `v1<-v[which(v==7)]` 
        * for multidimentional structures (matrices and dataframes) use [row, column] index to extract individual elements
            * Use `myOrder_df` dataframe: get first3 rows:
                * `myOrder_df[1:3, ]`
    * By name index: If the elements of your data structures have names, you can extract the value by name:
        * name our `myOrder` list: `names(myOrder)<-c("item", "type","cost")`
        * extract the first element of the list by name: `myOrder["item"]`
            * what type of data structure is returned? `str()`, `typeof()` --> LIST
        * you can also use `$` operator to subset by name (for lists and dataframes):
            * Try `myOrder$item` ; What type is returned? --> VECTOR
    * by logical vector index: selects values corresponding to TRUE values of logical vector
        * `v<-c(1,4,4,7,8)` and I want to get back all the elements of v such that v is equal to 4:
            * `v1<-v[v==4]`; Try only `v==4`
            * `v2<-v[v>4]`; Try only `v>4`
        * Use `myOrder_df` dataframe:select rows that satisfy various conditions
            * `df1<-myOrder_df[myOrder_df$menuType=="solid", ]`
            * `df2<-myOrder_df[myOrder_df$menuCost>3, ]`
            * `df3<-myOrder_df[which(myOrder_df$menuCost>3), ]` ;  how is it different from the previous line?
            

## 4. Overview using our gapminder dataset:

Let's return to our gapminder dataset that you have downloaded to SCW_Jan2016/Sunday_AM/data/gapminderData.csv

Before we examine our data, let's read this dataset into R:

* Method 1: Use `read.csv()` function

    * `myData<-read.csv("gapminderData.csv")`
    * Take a look at the new object `myData` 

A bit hard to see? Different ways to see what your object looks like:

    * Use `head()` function:
        * `head(myData)`
    * Look at the top right window, environment tab - gives you a brief summary of the object and Excel-like format

    
* Method 2. Use `read.table()` function

**Challenge 4.1** Purpose: read data into R.

**Together** Now we know how read in dataframes into R. Let's play with this dataset to go over what we talked about this morning.

    * Overall object structure?
    * Can you tell what is the data type of elements in each cloumn?
    * Can you extract 3rd and 5th column of the dataset?
    * Can you extract the list of countries in this dataset
    * Can you get a part of this dataset that includes information about Sweden?
    * can you extract all countries for which life expectancy is below 70?
    * Can you make a new column that contains population in units of millions of people?
    * and so on for as long as I have time...
    
##Summary

  * R is made up objects and functions [that manipulate objects in various ways]
  * Objects and functions can be as simple or as complex as you want them to be (builtin + custom-made). Name some data structures/functions you know?
  * Help functions are super valuble to write your own code or navigate through script written by others. Do you remember what they are?
  
####**You are now ready to use R objects and functions to write your script**
