**Challenge 1.1**  Learn how to pass arguments to function

```
Use setwd() function to navigate  to `SCW_Jan2016` folder. We want to set it as our working directory.

```

**Challenge 1.2**  Learn how to assign values to variables 

```
What will be the value of each  variable  after each statement in the following code?

> mass <- 47.5
> age <- 122
> mass <- mass * 2.3
> age <- age - 20
```


**Challenge 2.1**  Learn how to read the output of nested help functions

```
Break the following expression into multiple single function calls. You will need to assign the output of each function to a variable that will serve as input(argument) for a next function. What does the output of each steps tell you? Assign: `score<-"High"`

is.logical(is.numeric(typeof(is.integer(score))))
```

**Challenge 2.2**  Learn how to construct lists

```
Try to create a list named `myOrder` that contains the following data structures as list elements:

* Element 1 is a character vector of length 4 that lists the menu items you just ordered from the restaurant
* Element 2 is a factor that describes menu items as "liquid" or "solid"
* Element 3 is a list that contains the address of the restaurant and the total dollar amount of your order

    *Hint: Define your elements first, than create a list with them.
```       

**Challenge 4.1** Learn how to read data tables into R
```
Use help functions to read about read.table `?read.table()` or `args(read.table)`
and use it load file into R. It might be helpful to compare `args(read.csv)` and `args(read.table)`

Look at `dim(myData)` output after each try. Is it different? Why?
