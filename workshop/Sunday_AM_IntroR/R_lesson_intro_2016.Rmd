###Topics covered

* General introduction to R
* RStudio
* Variables
* Data Types
* Data Structures
    * Emphasis on Data Frame
* Subsetting data

Lessons are based on Topics1-6 of http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/

##Introduction to R

* after Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka and the Bell Labs language ‘S’ 
* statistical analysis, graphics, general purpose programming
* open source, active contributing community, documentation
* basic installation includes a handful of packages, but thousands are available


##Introduction to R studio

###manage projects

###running interactive sessions (immediate output)
* calculator
    * `3+8`
    * `34/2`
    * `4**3`
* text
    * `This is text`
* functions
    * `getwd()` notice paranthesis - indicates that this is a function

* functions with arguments

    * `sqrt(4)`  4 here is a value passed to `sqrt()` function.
Functions operate on objects that are enclosed in paranthesis

**Challenge**

Print the value of `sqrt(4)` using `print()` function. Try: 

`print 2`, `print(2)`, `print sqrt(4)` and `print(sqrt(4))`

Notice: *functions can be nested*


##Variables, data types, data structures

####Variables:
* assigning values to a variable

####Data Types:
* numeric
    * integer
    * double
* character
* logical
* complex

typeof() # what is its atomic type?
is.logical() # is it TRUE/FALSE data?
is.numeric() # is it numeric?
is.integer() # is it an integer?
is.complex() # is it complex number data?
is.character() # is it character data?
str()  # what is it?

####Data Structures:
* vectors
    * to create: 
    * to access elements
* lists
    * to create:
    * to access:
        * list elements
        * elements with list elements
* factors
* matrix
* data frames



###Help functions
There are many help function available to orient you in R

* Help with functions:

    * `?print`
     
    * `args(plot)`
    
* Help with data types


* Help with data structures

Distribute below functions to fit above heading..
class() # what is the data structure?
typeof() # what is its atomic type?
length() # how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
attributes() # does it have any metadata?
str() # A full summary of the entire object
dim() # Dimensions of the object - also try nrow(), ncol()

**Challenges**
Ask to construct various data structures

###Working with data frames

Download gapminder dataset:

* Set directory to your project directory

    * `setwd()`

To download from shell (use Git Bash we worked with earlier): [add URL to etherpad]

* `curl -O https://annawilliford.github.io/2016-01-30-UTA/data/gapminderData.csv`

To download from R:

* `download.file("https://annawilliford.github.io/2016-01-30/data/gapminderData.csv", destfile="gapminderData.txt", method="libcurl")`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point you just have the data file in the directory of your choice. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a look at your directory structure in the bottom right window under Files tab

To load data into R: assign file to a variable `myData`
Method 1:

* `myData<-read.csv("gapminderData.csv")`

Take a look at a new object

* `myData`

A bit hard to see?
Different ways to see what your object looks like: 

* Use `head()` function:
    * `head(myData)`

* Look at the top right window, environment tab - gives you a brief summary \
of the object and Excel-like view of the data

* Use `str()` help function
    * str(myData)

Method 2. Use read.table() function

**Challenge**
Use help functions to read about read.table `?read.table()` or `args(read.table)` \
and use it load file into R. It might be helpful to compare `args(read.csv)` and `args(read.table)`

Look at `dim(myData)` output after each try. Is it different? Why?

**Answer**
* myData2<-read.table("gapminderData.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ",")

Unless we recorder the data, we do not know its format. It is easiest to take a look at the data \
with other tools.  How would you use bash shell to see the format of gapminderData.csv?

####Understanding your data structure.
Use functions below to understnd your data set:
class() # what is the data structure?
typeof() # what is its atomic type?
length() # how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
attributes() # does it have any metadata?
str() # A full summary of the entire object
dim() # Dimensions of the object - also try nrow(), ncol()

####Lists as output
Not sure if will use

####Subsetting
